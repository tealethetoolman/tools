Description:
	toolman is an app that is currently run by main.pl. I'm working on better modularizing the different components, but right now it works. This utility has the following functions:
		*The ability to quit
		*Interactive menus
		*OTX key and file management
		*OTX request module
		*Simple configuration interface
		*Cleanup and Garbage Collection

FUTURE

	I have some plans for this app. For one, I want to modularize the display system and the logging system. Here is a list of the upcoming features and their priorities.

	NAME				Priority
	Display Module			10
	Logging Module			7
	Core Module			10
	Config Module
	Web Module			10
	JSON Parsing Ability		10
