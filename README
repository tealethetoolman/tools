NAME
	toolman - an interactive application to do common taks.

SYNOPSIS

	perl ./main.pl

TERMS	
		OTX: AlienVault Open Threat Exchange

Description:
	toolman is an app that is currently run by main.pl. I'm working on better modularizing the different components, but right now it works. This utility has the following functions:
		*The ability to quit
		*Interactive menus
		*OTX key and file management
		*OTX request module
		*Simple configuration interface
		*Cleanup and Garbage Collection

FUTURE

	I have some plans for this app. For one, I want to modularize the display system and the logging system. Here is a list of the upcoming features and their priorities.

	NAME				Priority
	Display Module			10
	Logging Module			7
	Core Module			10
	Config Module
	Web Module			10
	JSON Parsing Ability		10

NOTES	
	right now, i only have display module going into the packages as offsets packages from main. in the rest, i use explicit scoped declarations. when I get a package other than display, i will use it. it being this http://search.cpan.org/~preaction/Import-Base-1.004/lib/Import/Base.pm which will allow me to defin my base set of packages and just include that into the packages.
